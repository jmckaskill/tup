# This was found while trying to compile ncurses. A shell script is executed to
# generate a header file. The script creates some temporary files (so they show
# up as outputs to the command), but the files are then removed. However, they
# stick around as outputs, so the next time the Tupfile is modified, they end
# up getting moved over to delete. Either way, those temporary files shouldn't
# show up in the tup db (basically, these are ephemeral files, only instead of
# the monitor they come in from the ldpreload/wrapper).
