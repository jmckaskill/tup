# When we explicitly list the input files (without foreach), the behavior in
# the parser is a bit different. Specifically, the output file isn't put into
# the database until later in the parsing, after the rule that needs that
# output has done a select on it. This addresses a specific bug discovered
# while tupifying sysvinit.

# Run a second time, since in theory this time foo.o is in the database, but
# will be moved to DELETE before the Tupfile is re-parsed. So, it's slightly
